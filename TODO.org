* TODO Fix infinite loop when host# is too large

  Right now, if you pick a very large number of hosts, the loop that
  generates hosts will just loop forever, since there's a finite
  universe that's available.

* TODO Adjust stats so smaller number of hosts have failures.
  
  The views that you get when you subscribe to the data stream are
  kinda too big now, if you look, for example, at the hosts with
  failures. We should make the arrival rate of failures smaller, so we
  don't just got a big constant fraction with failures.
